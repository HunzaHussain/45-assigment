/*Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.8*/


// Version that passes:
let alien_colour = "green "


// VERSION 1
// Version that runs  the if blocks
 alien_colour ="green"

if (alien_colour== "green") {
    console.log("You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien!");
    
}else{
    console.log("You just earned 10 points");
